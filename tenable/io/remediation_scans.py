:devportal:`Remediation scan create <io-scans-remediation-creates>` API endpoints.
:devportal:`Remediation scan list <io-scans-remediation-list>` API endpoints.

    The Remediation scans iterator provides a scalable way to work through
    scan history result sets of any size. The iterator will walk through
    each page of data, returning one record at a time.  If it reaches the
    end of a page of records, then it will request the next page of
    information and then continue to return records from the next page
    (and the next, and the next) until the counter reaches the total number
    of records that the API has reported.

    Attributes:
        count (int): The current number of records that have been returned
        page (list):
            The current page of data being walked through.  pages will be
            cycled through as the iterator requests more information from the
            API.
        page_count (int): The number of record returned from the current page.
        total (int):
            The total number of records that exist for the current request.
