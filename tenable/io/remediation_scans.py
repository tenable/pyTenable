class RemediationScans(TIOIterator):
    '''
The Remediation scans iterator provides a scalable way to work through
scan history result sets of any size. The iterator will walk through
each page of data, returning one record at a time.  If it reaches the
end of a page of records, then it will request the next page of
information and then continue to return records from the next page
(and the next, and the next) until the counter reaches the total number
of records that the API has reported.

Attributes:
    count (int): The current number of records that have been returned
    page (list):
        The current page of data being walked through.  pages will be
        cycled through as the iterator requests more information from the
        API.
    page_count (int): The number of record returned from the current page.
    total (int):
        The total number of records that exist for the current request.
