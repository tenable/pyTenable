exports
=======

The following methods allow for interaction into the Tenable.io 
`exports <https://cloud.tenable.com/api#/resources/exports>`_ 
API endpoints.

Methods available on ``tio.exports``:

        Args:
            cidr_range (str, optional):
                Restrict the export to only vulns assigned to assets within the
                CIDR range specified.
            first_found (int, optional):
                Specifies the earliest time for a vulnerability to have been
                discovered.  Format is a unix timestamp integer.
            last_fixed (int, optional):
                Specifies the earliest time that vulnerabilities may have been
                fixed.  Format is a unix timestamp integer.
            last_found (int, optional):
                Specifies the earliest time that a vulnerability may have been
                last seen.  Format is a unix timestamp integer.
            num_assets (int, optional):
                Specifies the number of assets returned per-chunk.  If nothing is
                specified, it will default to 50 assets.
            plugin_family (list, optional):
                list of plugin families to restrict the export to.  values are
                interpreted with an insensitivity to case.
            severity (list, optional):
                list of severities to include as part of the export.  Supported
                values are `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `critical`.
            since (int, optional):
                Returned results will be bounded based on the state of the
                vulnerability instance detailed below.  This parameter expects a
                unix timestamp.

                * Vulns in the **open** state are bounded by ``first_found``.
                * Vulns in the **reopened** state are bounded by ``last_found``.
                * Vulns in the **fixed** state are bounded by ``last_fixed``.

                In short it'll return active vulnerabilities based on when they
                were first discovered, and fixed and resurfaced vulnerabilities
                based on when they were last observed.  The idea is to relay
                state changes of a vulnerability and use a singular export to
                track all of these state changes.
            state (list, optional):
                list of object states to be returned.  Supported values are
                `open`, `reopened`, and `fixed`.
            tags (list, optional):
                List of tag key-value pairs that must be associated to the
                vulnerability data to be returned.  Key-value pairs are tuples
                ``('key', 'value')`` and are case-sensitive.
