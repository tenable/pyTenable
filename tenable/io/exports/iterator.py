'''
As exports are asynchronous, pyTenable by default will return an iterator to
handle the state tracking, data chunking, and presentation of the data in order
to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that would otherwise have to be
created.  These iterators support both serial iteration and threaded
handling of data depending on how the data is accessed.

    The export iterator can be used to handle the downloading and processing

            Should the items returned be converted to a Box object?
        chunks (list[int]):
            The list of chunks yet to be handled.
        processed (list[int]):
            The list of chunks already processed.
        page (list[dict]):
            The current chunk of data.
        chunk_id (int):
            The current chunk id.
        timeout (int):
            A timeout in seconds to wait for the job to start processing
            before cancelling.
        uuid:
            The export job UUID.
        type:
            The datatype for the export job.
        status:
            The current status of the job.
        start_time:
            The timestamp denoting when the iterator was created.
