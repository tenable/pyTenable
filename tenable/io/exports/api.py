                to be processed, the timeout is ignored.
            iterator (Iterator, optional):
                Supports overloading the iterator class to be used to process
                the datachunks.

        Args:

                be returned.
            last_fixed (int, optional):
                Findings fixed after this timestamp will be returned.  Note
                that this filter only applies to fixed data and should not be
                used when searching for active findings.
            last_found (int, optional):
                Findings last observed after this timestamp will be returned.
            since (int, optional):
                Findings last observed in any state after this timestamp will
                be returned.  Cannot be used with ``last_found``,
                ``first_found``, or ``last_fixed``.

            severity (list[str], optional):

                Only returns findings that meet the specified VPR criteria.
                The filter is formatted as a dictionary with the mathematical
                operation as the key.  Supported operations are:

                    :widths: auto

                      - list[float]

                      - list[float]

                      - float
                      - VPR scores must be greater than the specified value.
                    * - ``gte``
                      - float
                      - VPR scores must be greater than or equal to the
                        specified value.
                    * - ``lt``
                      - float
                      - VPR scores must be less than the specified value.
                    * - ``lte``
                      - float
                      - VPR scores must be less than or equal to the
                        specified value.
            network_id (str, optional):
                Only findings within the specified network UUID will be
                returned.
            cidr_range (str, optional):
                Restrict the export to only vulns assigned to assets within the
                CIDR range specified.
            tags (list[tuple[str, str]], optional):
                A list of tag pairs to filter the results on.  The tag pairs
                should be presented as ``('CATEGORY', 'VALUE')``.
            include_unlicensed (bool, optional):
                Should findings for assets that are not licensed be included in
                the results?
            num_assets (int, optional):
                As findings are grouped by asset, how many assets's findings
                should exist within each data chunk?  If left unspecified the
                default is ``500``.
            uuid (str, optional):
                A predefined export UUID to use for generating an
                ExportIterator.  Using this parameter will ignore all of the
                filter arguments.
            use_iterator (bool, optional):
                Determines if we should return an iterator, or simply the
                export job UUID.  The default is to return an iterator.
            when_done (bool, optional):
                When creating the iterator, setting this flag to true will tell
                the iterator to wait until the export job has completed before
                processing the first chunk.  The default behaviour is to start
                processing chunks of data as soon as they become available.
            timeout (int, optional):
                If specified, determines a timeout in seconds to wait for the
                export job to sit in the queue before cancelling the job and
                raising a ``TioExportsTimeout`` error.  Once a job has started
                to be processed, the timeout is ignored.
            iterator (Iterator, optional):
                Supports overloading the iterator class to be used to process
                the datachunks.
            adopt_existing (bool, optional):
                Should we automatically adopt an existing Job UUID with we
                receive a 409 conflict?  Defaults to True.

            Getting findings that have the the ``Region:Chicago`` tag:
