Common Themes
=============

Tenable.sc CRUD within pyTenable
--------------------------------

pyTenable allows for the ability to leverage both the naturalized inputs as well
as passing the raw parameters within the same structure.  In some cases this
doesn't seem immediately obvious, however allows for the ability to pass
parameters that either haven't yet been, or in some cases, may never be
interpreted by the library.  For example, in the alerts API, you could pass
the snake_cased ``always_exec_on_trigger`` or you could pass what the API
endpoint itself expects, which is ``executeOnEveryTrigger``.  The snake-cased
version expects a boolean value, which will be converted into the string value
that camelCased variant expects.  You'll see this behavior a lot throughout the
library, and is intended to allow you to sidestep most things should you need
to.  For example, in the alerts API again, you may not want to pass a trigger
as ``trigger=('sumip', '>=', '100')`` and instead pass as the parameters that
are to be written into the JSON request: 
``triggerName='sumip', triggerOperator='>=', triggerValue='100'``.  Both of
these methods will produce the same JSON request, and the the option is yours
to use the right way for the job.  Along these same lines, its possible to see
how the JSON documents are being constructed by simply looking at the
``_constructor`` methods for each APIEndpoint class.  If pyTenable is getting in
your way with the, you can almost always sidestep it and pass the exact 
dictionary you wish to pass on to the API.

Schedule Dictionaries
---------------------

A dictionary detailing the repeating schedule within Tenable.sc.  This 
dictionary consists of 1 or 3 parameters, depending on the type of schedule.  
In all of the definitions except ``ical``, a  single parameter of ``type`` is 
passed with lone of the following values: ``ical``, ``never``, ``rollover``, and
``template``.  If no document is specified, then the default of ``never`` is 
assumed.  For repeating scans, you'll have to use the type of ``ical`` and also 
specify the ``start`` and ``rrule`` parameters as well.  The ``start`` parameter 
is an `iCal DateTime Form #3 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.5>`_
formatted string specifying the date and time in which to start the repeating 
event.  The ``rrule`` parameter is an 
`iCal Recurrance Rule <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10>`_
formatted string.

* Example Never Declaration:

.. code-block:: python

    {'type': 'never'}

* Example daily event starting at 9am Eastern

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'type': 'ical',
        'start': 'TZID=America/New York:20190214T090000',
        'rrule': 'FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1'
    }

* Example weekly event every Saturday at 8:30pm Eastern

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'type': 'ical',
        'start': 'TZID=America/New York:20190214T203000',
        'rrule': 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA;INTERVAL=1'
    }

There are detailed instructions in the RFC documentation on how to construct
these recurrence rules.  Further there are some packages out there to aid in 
converting more human-readable text into recurrence rules, such as the 
`recurrent package <https://pypi.org/project/recurrent/>`_ for example.
