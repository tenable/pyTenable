Common Themes
=============

Tenable.sc CRUD within pyTenable
--------------------------------

pyTenable allows for the ability to leverage both the naturalized inputs as well
as passing the raw parameters within the same structure.  In some cases this
doesn't seem immediately obvious, however allows for the ability to pass
parameters that either haven't yet been, or in some cases, may never be
interpreted by the library.

For example, in the alerts API, you could pass the snake_cased
``always_exec_on_trigger`` or you could pass what the API endpoint itself
expects, which is ``executeOnEveryTrigger``.  The snake-cased version expects a
boolean value, which will be converted into the string value that camelCased
variant expects.  You'll see this behavior a lot throughout the library, and is
intended to allow you to sidestep most things should you need to.  For example,
in the alerts API again, you may not want to pass a trigger as
``trigger=('sumip', '>=', '100')`` and instead pass as the parameters that are
to be written into the JSON request:
``triggerName='sumip', triggerOperator='>=', triggerValue='100'``.  Both of
these methods will produce the same JSON request, and the the option is yours
to use the right way for the job.

Along these same lines, its possible to see how the JSON documents are being
constructed by simply looking at the ``_constructor`` methods for each
APIEndpoint class.  If pyTenable is getting in your way, you can almost always
sidestep it and pass the exact dictionary you wish to pass on to the API.

Schedule Dictionaries
---------------------

A dictionary detailing the repeating schedule within Tenable.sc.  This
dictionary consists of 1 or 3 parameters, depending on the type of schedule.
In all of the definitions except ``ical``, a  single parameter of ``type`` is
passed with lone of the following values: ``ical``, ``never``, ``rollover``, and
``template``.  If no document is specified, then the default of ``never`` is
assumed.  For repeating scans, you'll have to use the type of ``ical`` and also
specify the ``start`` and ``repeatRule`` parameters as well.  The ``start``
parameter is an
`iCal DateTime Form #3 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.5>`_
formatted string specifying the date and time in which to start the repeating
event.  The ``repeatRule`` parameter is an
`iCal Recurrence Rule <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10>`_
formatted string.

* Example Never Declaration:

.. code-block:: python

    {'type': 'never'}

* Example daily event starting at 9am Eastern

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'type': 'ical',
        'start': 'TZID=America/New_York:20190214T090000',
        'repeatRule': 'FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1'
    }

* Example weekly event every Saturday at 8:30pm Eastern

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'type': 'ical',
        'start': 'TZID=America/New_York:20190214T203000',
        'repeatRule': 'FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA;INTERVAL=1'
    }

There are detailed instructions in the RFC documentation on how to construct
these recurrence rules.  Further there are some packages out there to aid in
converting more human-readable text into recurrence rules, such as the
`recurrent package <https://pypi.org/project/recurrent/>`_ for example.
