CPE uses a standardized format to identify software, which makes it easier to track and manage software assets.\n\nHere are some key points to understand about CPE:\n- **CPE is a standard format for identifying software**. The CPE format consists of a vendor name, product name, version, and edition. This makes it easy to identify software and track changes over time.\n- **CPE can be used to identify both installed and uninstalled software**. This makes it a valuable tool for software inventory and asset management.\n- **CPE can be used to generate reports on software usage**. This information can be used to make decisions about software licensing and usage.\n\n## Example:\n```\nCPE:2.3:Microsoft:Windows_Server:2012_R2:SP1\n```\n\nThis CPE identifies Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Service Pack 1.\n"},

It is a number that is used to identify the application or service that is running on a computer. Ports are used by the TCP/IP protocol to route data to the correct application.\n\nThere are two main types of ports: well-known ports and registered ports. Well-known ports are ports that are used by specific applications. For example, port 80 is used for HTTP, port 22 is used for SSH, and port 443 is used for HTTPS. Registered ports are ports that are assigned to specific applications by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\n\nPorts can be used to identify both the source and destination of network traffic. For example, if a computer is sending data to port 80 on another computer, then the source port is the port on the sending computer and the destination port is the port on the receiving computer.\n\nPorts can also be used to control access to network services. For example, a firewall can be configured to allow or deny traffic to specific ports. This can be used to block access to certain applications or services.\n\nPorts are an important part of the TCP/IP protocol and are used to route data to the correct application. They can also be used to identify the source and destination of network traffic and to control access to network services.\n"},

For example, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used to encrypt data that is transmitted over the internet. This helps to protect sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and passwords, from being intercepted by malicious actors.\n\nProtocols are also used to authenticate users and devices. For example, the Kerberos protocol is used to authenticate users on a network. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to resources.\n\nProtocols are an essential part of cyber security.

It can be a software vendor, a repository, or a third-party website. The source of a software is important because it can affect its security and reliability. For example, software obtained from a reputable vendor is more likely to be secure than software obtained from an unknown source.\n\nHere are some key points to understand about sources in the context of the cyber industry:\n- **Software Vendors**: These are companies that develop and sell software. They are the primary source of software for most organizations.\n- **Repositories**: These are online storage locations where software can be downloaded. Repositories can be public or private. Public repositories are open to anyone, while private repositories are only accessible to authorized users.\n- **Third-Party Websites**: These are websites that offer software for download. They can be legitimate or malicious. Legitimate third-party websites offer software from reputable vendors, while malicious third-party websites offer software that is infected with malware.\n\nIt is important to be aware of the source of software before installing it. Software obtained from a reputable source is more likely to be secure and reliable.\n"},

If a software is seen on a device that it is not typically installed on, it may be a sign that the device has been compromised.\n- **Last seen can be used to track the movement of software across devices**.
