This ensures that each asset can be easily identified and tracked.\n- **Accuracy**: Asset IDs must be accurate and up-to-date. This ensures that the asset management system has the most accurate information about each asset.\n- **Consistency**: Asset IDs must be consistent across all systems and applications that use them.

For example, all laptops might be considered one asset subtype, while all desktops might be considered another.\n- **Asset Classes and Asset Groups**: Asset classes can also be used to group assets together into asset groups. For example, all assets that are located in the same building might be considered one asset group, while all assets that are owned by the same department might be considered another.\n\nAsset classes can be a valuable tool for managing and understanding assets.
