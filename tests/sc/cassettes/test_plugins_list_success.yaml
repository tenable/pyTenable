        of the parallels-server-bm-release \/\nvzkernel \/ etc packages installed,
        the Virtuozzo installation on the\nremote host is affected by the following
        vulnerabilities :\n\n  - [x86 AMD] An industry-wide issue was found in the
        way\n    many modern microprocessor designs have implemented\n    speculative
        execution of Load & Store instructions (a\n    commonly used performance optimization).
        It relies on\n    the presence of a precisely-defined instruction\n    sequence
        in the privileged code as well as the fact\n    that memory read from address
        to which a recent memory\n    write has occurred may see an older value and\n    subsequently
        cause an update into the microprocessor''s\n    data cache even for speculatively
        executed instructions\n    that never actually commit (retire). As a result,
        an\n    unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read\n    privileged
        memory by conducting targeted cache\n    side-channel attacks.\n\n  - By mmap()ing
        a FUSE-backed file onto a process''s memory\n    containing command line arguments
        (or environment\n    strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils\n    or
        procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which\n    makes a read() call
        to the \/proc\/<pid>\/cmdline (or\n    \/proc\/<pid>\/environ) files to block
        indefinitely\n    (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as a\n    synchronization
        primitive for other attacks).\n\n  - A Floating Point Unit (FPU) state information
        leakage\n    flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel saved and\n    restored
        the FPU state during task switch. Linux\n    kernels that follow the ''Lazy
        FPU Restore'' scheme are\n    vulnerable to the FPU state information leakage
        issue.\n    An unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to\n    read
        FPU state bits by conducting targeted cache\n    side-channel attacks, similar
        to the Meltdown\n    vulnerability disclosed earlier this year.\n\n  - A flaw
        was found in the way the Linux kernel handled\n    exceptions delivered after
        a stack switch operation via\n    Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the
        stack switch\n    operation, processor does not deliver interrupts and\n    exceptions,
        they are delivered once the first\n    instruction after the stack switch
        is executed. An\n    unprivileged system user could use this flaw to crash\n    the
        system kernel resulting in DoS. This CVE-2018-10872\n    was assigned due
        to regression of CVE-2018-8897.\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has

        heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The\nfunction handling incoming NTLM type-2
        messages\n(`lib\/vauth\/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate\nincoming

        that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server\ncould trick libcurl to accept
        a bad length + offset combination that\nwould lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.(CVE-2018-16890)\n\nThe
        NTLM authentication feature in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 on\n32-bit platforms
        allows attackers to cause a denial of service\n(integer overflow and resultant
        buffer overflow, and application\ncrash) or possibly have unspecified other

        and libcurl before 7.57.0 on 32-bit platforms allow attackers to\ncause a
        denial of service (out-of-bounds access and application crash)\nor possibly
        have unspecified other impact because too little memory is\nallocated for
        interfacing to an SSL library.(CVE-2017-8818)\n\nlibcurl may read outside
        of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP.\nWhen libcurl connects to an FTP
        server and successfully logs in\n(anonymous or not), it asks the server for
        the current directory with\nthe `PWD` command. The server then responds with
        a 257 response\ncontaining the path, inside double quotes. The returned path
        name is\nthen kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string\nparser
        for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but\nwithout a
        closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a\ntrailing NUL byte
        to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would\nthen later access the
        string, it could read beyond the allocated heap\nbuffer and crash or wrongly
        access data beyond the buffer, thinking it\nwas part of the path. A malicious
        server could abuse this fact and\neffectively prevent libcurl-based clients
        to work with it - the PWD\ncommand is always issued on new FTP connections
        and the mistake has a\nhigh chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact
        that this has issue\nremained undiscovered for this long could suggest that
        malformed PWD\nresponses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any
        exploit\nof this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit\n[415d2e7cb7](https:\/\/github.com\/curl\/curl\/commit\/415d2e7cb7),
        March\n2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates
        the\nstring but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final\ndouble
        quote.(CVE-2017-1000254)\n\nCurl versions 7.14.1 through 7.61.1 are vulnerable
        to a heap-based\nbuffer over-read in the tool_msgs.c:voutf() function that
        may result\nin information exposure and denial of service.(CVE-2018-16842)\n\nlibcurl
        is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function\ncreating an
        outgoing NTLM type-3 header\n(`lib\/vauth\/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()`),
        generates\nthe request HTTP header contents based on previously received data.\nThe
        check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting\noverflowed is
        implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it\ndoes not prevent
        the overflow from happening. This output data can\ngrow larger than the local
        buffer if very large ''nt response'' data is\nextracted from a previous NTLMv2
        header provided by the malicious or\nbroken HTTP server. Such a ''large value''
        needs to be around 1000 bytes\nor more. The actual payload data copied to
        the target buffer comes\nfrom the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.(CVE-2019-3822)\n\nlibcurl
        is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds read in the code\nhandling the end-of-response
        for SMTP. If the buffer passed to\n`smtp_endofresp()` isn''t NUL terminated
        and contains no character\nending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5,
        then the `strtol()`\ncall reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents
        will not be\nreturned to the caller.(CVE-2019-3823)\n\nThe FTP wildcard function
        in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial
        of service (out-of-bounds read and\napplication crash) or possibly have unspecified
        other impact via a\nstring that ends with an ''['' character.(CVE-2017-8817)\n\nset_file_metadata
        in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file''s\norigin URL in the user.xdg.origin.url

        allows local users\nto obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials contained
        in the\nURL) by reading this attribute, as demonstrated by getfattr. This
        also\napplies to Referer information in the user.xdg.referrer.url metadata\nattribute.
        According to 2016-07-22 in the Wget ChangeLog,\nuser.xdg.origin.url was partially
        based on the behavior of\nfwrite_xattr in tool_xattr.c in curl.(CVE-2018-20483)\n\nA
        buffer overrun flaw was found in the IMAP handler of libcurl. By\ntricking

        the application.(CVE-2017-1000257)\n\nA heap use-after-free flaw was found
        in curl versions from 7.59.0\nthrough 7.61.1 in the code related to closing
        an easy handle. When\nclosing and cleaning up an ''easy'' handle in the `Curl_close()`\nfunction,
        the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the\npointer) and might
        then subsequently erroneously write to a struct\nfield within that already

        NULL pointer dereference in the function _TIFFmemcmp at tif_unix.c\n(called
        from TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction) allows an attacker\nto cause a
        denial of service through a crafted tiff file. This\nvulnerability can be
        triggered by the executable tiffcp.\n\nCVE-2018-19210\n\nThere is a NULL pointer
        dereference in the TIFFWriteDirectorySec\nfunction in tif_dirwrite.c that
        will lead to a denial of service\nattack, as demonstrated by tiffset.\n\nCVE-2019-7663\n\nAn
        Invalid Address dereference was discovered in\nTIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction
        in libtiff\/tif_dirwrite.c,\naffecting the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function
        in tiffcp.c. Remote\nattackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause
        a\ndenial of service via a crafted tiff file.\n\nWe believe this is the same
        as CVE-2018-17000 (above).\n\nFor Debian 8 ''Jessie'', these problems have
        been fixed in version\n4.0.3-12.3+deb8u8.\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade
        your tiff packages.\n\nNOTE: Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding

        SLES15 Security Update : dovecot23 (SUSE-SU-2019:0414-1)","description":"This
        update for dovecot23 fixes the following issues :\n\ndovecot was updated to
        2.3.3 release, bringing lots of bugfixes\n(bsc#1124356).\n\nAlso the following
        security issue was fixed :\n\nCVE-2019-3814: A vulnerability in Dovecot related
        to SSL client\ncertificate authentication was fixed (bsc#1123022)\n\nThe package
        changes :\n\nUpdated pigeonhole to 0.5.3: Fix assertion panic occurring when\nmanagesieve
        service fails to open INBOX while saving a Sieve script.\nThis was caused
        by a lack of cleanup after failure.\n\nFix specific messages causing an assert
        panic with actions that\ncompose a reply (e.g. vacation). With some rather
        weird input from the\noriginal message, the header folding algorithm (as used
        for composing\nthe References header for the reply) got confused, causing
        the panic.\n\nIMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix FILTER SIEVE SCRIPT command
        parsing.\nAfter finishing reading the Sieve script, the command parsing\nsometimes
        didn''t continue with the search arguments. This is a time-\ncritical bug
        that likely only occurs when the Sieve script is sent in\nthe next TCP frame.\n\ndovecot23
        was updated to 2.3.3: doveconf hides more secrets now in the\ndefault output.\n\nssl_dh
        setting is no longer enforced at startup. If it''s not set and\nnon-ECC DH
        key exchange happens, error is logged and client is\ndisconnected.\n\nAdded
        log_debug=<filter> setting. <\/filter>\n\nAdded log_core_filter=<log filter>
        setting. <\/log>\n\nquota-clone: Write to dict asynchronously\n\n--enable-hardening
        attempts to use retpoline Spectre 2 mitigations\n\nlmtp proxy: Support source_ip
        passdb extra field.\n\ndoveadm stats dump: Support more fields and output
        stddev by default.\n\npush-notification: Add SSL support for OX backend.\n\nNUL
        bytes in mail headers can cause truncated replies when fetched.\n\ndirector:
        Conflicting host up\/down state changes may in some rare\nsituations ended
        up in a loop of two directors constantly overwriting\neach others'' changes.\n\ndirector:
        Fix hang\/crash when multiple doveadm commands are being\nhandled concurrently.\n\ndirector:
        Fix assert-crash if doveadm disconnects too early\n\nvirtual plugin: Some
        searches used 100% CPU for many seconds\n\ndsync assert-crashed with acl plugin
        in some situations. (bsc#1119850)\n\nmail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save
        assert-crashed\nwith some specific Sieve scripts.\n\nMail snippet generation
        crashed with mails containing invalid\nContent-Type:multipart header.\n\nLog
        prefix ordering was different for some log lines.\n\nquota: With noenforcing
        option current quota usage wasn''t updated.\n\nauth: Kerberos authentication
        against Samba assert-crashed.\n\nstats clients were unnecessarily chatty with
        the stats server.\n\nimapc: Fixed various assert-crashes when reconnecting
        to server.\n\nlmtp, submission: Fix potential crash if client disconnects
        while\nhandling a command.\n\nquota: Fixed compiling with glibc-2.26 \/ support
        libtirpc.\n\nfts-solr: Empty search values resulted in 400 Bad Request errors\n\nfts-solr:
        default_ns parameter couldn''t be used\n\nsubmission server crashed if relay
        server returned over 7 lines in a\nreply (e.g. to EHLO)\n\ndovecot was updated
        to 2.3.2.1: SSL\/TLS servers may have crashed\nduring client disconnection\n\nlmtp:
        With lmtp_rcpt_check_quota=yes mail deliveries may have\nsometimes assert-crashed.\n\nv2.3.2:
        ''make check'' may have crashed with 32bit systems\n\ndovecot was updated
        to 2.3.2: old-stats plugin: Don''t temporarily\nenable PR_SET_DUMPABLE while
        opening \/proc\/self\/io. This may still\ncause security problems if the process
        is ptrace()d at the same time.\nInstead, open it while still running as root.\n\ndoveadm:
        Added mailbox cache decision&remove commands. See\ndoveadm-mailbox(1) man
        page for details.\n\ndoveadm: Added rebuild attachments command for rebuilding\n$HasAttachment
        or $HasNoAttachment flags for matching mails. See\ndoveadm-rebuild(1) man
        page for details.\n\ncassandra: Use fallback_consistency on more types of
        errors\n\nlmtp proxy: Support outgoing SSL\/TLS connections\n\nlmtp: Add lmtp_rawlog_dir
        and lmtp_proxy_rawlog_dir settings.\n\nsubmission: Add support for rawlog_dir\n\nsubmission:
        Add submission_client_workarounds setting.\n\nlua auth: Add password_verify()
        function and additional fields in auth\nrequest.\n\ndoveadm-server: TCP connections
        are hanging when there is a lot of\nnetwork output. This especially caused
        hangs in dsync-replication.\n\nUsing multiple type=shared mdbox namespaces
        crashed\n\nmail_fsync setting was ignored. It was always set to ''optimized''.\n\nlua
        auth: Fix potential crash at deinit\n\nSSL\/TLS servers may have crashed if
        client disconnected during\nhandshake.\n\nSSL\/TLS servers: Don''t send extraneous
        certificates to client when alt\ncerts are used.\n\nlda, lmtp: Return-Path
        header without ''\n\nlda, lmtp: Unencoded UTF-8 in email address headers may
        assert-crash\n\nlda: -f parameter didn''t allow empty\/null\/domainless address\n\nlmtp,
        submission: Message size limit was hard-coded to 40 MB.\nExceeding it caused
        the connection to get dropped during transfer.\n\nlmtp: Fix potential crash
        when delivery fails at DATA stage\n\nlmtp: login_greeting setting was ignored\n\nFix
        to work with OpenSSL v1.0.2f\n\nsystemd unit restrictions were too strict
        by default\n\nFix potential crashes when a lot of log output was produced\n\nSMTP
        client may have assert-crashed when sending mail\n\nIMAP COMPRESS: Send ''end
        of compression'' marker when disconnecting.\n\ncassandra: Fix consistency=quorum
        to work\n\ndsync: Lock file generation failed if home directory didn''t exist\n\nSnippet
        generation for HTML mails didn''t ignore &entities inside\nblockquotes, producing
        strange looking snippets.\n\nimapc: Fix assert-crash if getting disconnected
        and after reconnection\nall mails in the selected mailbox are gone.\n\npop3c:
        Handle unexpected server disconnections without assert-crash\n\nfts: Fixes
        to indexing mails via virtual mailboxes.\n\nfts: If mails contained NUL characters,
        the text around it wasn''t\nindexed.\n\nObsolete dovecot.index.cache offsets
        were sometimes used. Trying to\nfetch a field that was just added to cache
        file may not have always\nfound it.\n\npigeonhole was updated to 0.5.2: Implement
        plugin for the a\nvendor-defined IMAP capability called ''FILTER=SIEVE''.
        It adds the\nability to manually invoke Sieve filtering in IMAP. More information\ncan
        be found in doc\/plugins\/imap_filter_sieve.txt.\n\nThe Sieve addess test
        caused an assertion panic for invalid addresses\nwith UTF-8 codepoints in
        the localpart. Fixed by properly detecting\ninvalid addresses with UTF-8 codepoints
        in the localpart and skipping\nthese like other invalid addresses while iterating
        addresses for the\naddress test.\n\nMake the length of the subject header
        for the vacation response\nconfigurable and enforce the limit in UTF-8 codepoints
        rather than\nbytes. The subject header for a vacation response was statically\ntruncated
        to 256 bytes, which is too limited for multi-byte UTF-8\ncharacters.\n\nSieve
        editheader extension: Fix assertion panic occurring when it is\nused to manipulate
        a message header with a very large header field.\n\nProperly abort execution
        of the sieve_discard script upon error.\nBefore, the LDA Sieve plugin attempted
        to execute the sieve_discard\nscript when an error occurs. This can lead to
        the message being lost.\n\nFix the interaction between quota and the sieve_discard
        script. When\nquota was used together with a sieve_discard script, the message\ndelivery
        did not bounce when the quota was exceeded.\n\nFix crash for over quota users\n\nNote

        to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the\nEulerOS installation
        on the remote host is affected by the following\nvulnerabilities :\n\n  -
        A flaw was found in the Linux kernel''s ext4 filesystem.\n    A local user
        can cause an out-of-bounds write and a\n    denial of service or unspecified
        other impact is\n    possible by mounting and operating a crafted ext4\n    filesystem
        image.(CVE-2018-10878)\n\n  - An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in\n    net\/can\/gw.c
        in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The\n    CAN frame modification rules
        allow bitwise logical\n    operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc\n    field.
        Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may\n    write arbitrary content
        beyond the data registers in\n    the CAN controller''s I\/O memory when processing
        can-gw\n    manipulated outgoing frames. This is related to\n    cgw_csum_xor_rel.
        An unprivileged user can trigger a\n    system crash (general protection fault).(CVE-2019-3701)\n\n  -
        A flaw was found in the Linux kernel''s ext4 filesystem.\n    A local user
        can cause an out-of-bound access in\n    ext4_get_group_info function, a denial
        of service, and\n    a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted\n    ext4
        filesystem image.(CVE-2018-10881)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel''s
        ext4 filesystem\n    code. A stack-out-of-bounds write in\n    ext4_update_inline_data()
        is possible when mounting and\n    writing to a crafted ext4 image. An attacker
        could use\n    this to cause a system crash and a denial of\n    service.(CVE-2018-10880)\n\n  -
        The crypto API in the Linux kernel through 3.9-rc8 does\n    not initialize
        certain length variables, which allows\n    local users to obtain sensitive
        information from kernel\n    stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom
        system\n    call, related to the hash_recvmsg function in\n    crypto\/algif_hash.c
        and the skcipher_recvmsg function\n    in crypto\/algif_skcipher.c.(CVE-2013-3076)\n\n  -
        weakness was found in the Linux kernel''s implementation\n    of random seed
        data. Programs, early in the boot\n    sequence, could use the data allocated
        for the seed\n    before it was sufficiently generated.(CVE-2018-1108)\n\n  -
        An issue was discovered in the proc_pid_stack function\n    in fs\/proc\/base.c
        in the Linux kernel. An attacker with\n    a local account can trick the stack
        unwinder code to\n    leak stack contents to userspace. The fix allows only\n    root
        to inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary\n    task.(CVE-2018-17972)\n\n  -
        A security flaw was found in the\n    chap_server_compute_md5() function in
        the ISCSI target\n    code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication\n    request
        from an ISCSI initiator is processed. An\n    unauthenticated remote attacker
        can cause a stack\n    buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of the stack.\n    The
        attack requires the iSCSI target to be enabled on\n    the victim host. Depending
        on how the target''s code was\n    built (i.e. depending on a compiler, compile
        flags and\n    hardware architecture) an attack may lead to a system\n    crash
        and thus to a denial of service or possibly to a\n    non-authorized access
        to data exported by an iSCSI\n    target. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege\n    escalation
        cannot be fully ruled out, although we\n    believe it is highly unlikely.(CVE-2018-14633)\n\n  -
        An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before\n    4.18.6. An information
        leak in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status\n    in drivers\/cdrom\/cdrom.c could be
        used by local\n    attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from\n    unsigned
        long to int interferes with bounds\n    checking.(CVE-2018-16658)\n\n  - In
        the Linux kernel before 4.17, a local attacker able\n    to set attributes
        on an xfs filesystem could make this\n    filesystem non-operational until
        the next mount by\n    triggering an unchecked error condition during an xfs\n    attribute
        change, because xfs_attr_shortform_addname in\n    fs\/xfs\/libxfs\/xfs_attr.c
        mishandles ATTR_REPLACE\n    operations with conversion of an attr from short
        to\n    long form.(CVE-2018-18690)\n\n  - A security flaw was found in the
        Linux kernel in\n    drivers\/tty\/n_tty.c which allows local attackers (ones\n    who
        are able to access pseudo terminals) to lock them\n    up and block further
        usage of any pseudo terminal\n    devices due to an EXTPROC versus ICANON
        confusion in\n    TIOCINQ handler.(CVE-2018-18386)\n\n  - The Linux kernel
        was found to be vulnerable to a NULL\n    pointer dereference bug in the __netlink_ns_capable()\n    function
        in the net\/netlink\/af_netlink.c file. A local\n    attacker could exploit
        this when a net namespace with a\n    netnsid is assigned to cause a kernel
        panic and a\n    denial of service.(CVE-2018-14646)\n\nNote that Tenable Network
        Security has extracted the preceding\ndescription block directly from the
